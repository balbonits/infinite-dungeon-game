# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Session 18 — Shop/Forge UX Polish (2026-04-17)

#### Fixed
- **Focus highlight made item text unreadable.** Shop/Blacksmith list item buttons only overrode `font_color` (normal state). The GameWindow theme's `font_focus_color`/`font_hover_color` (both `BgDark`) bleed through when a row was focused, rendering black text on a dark-accent highlight. Fix: new `UiTheme.StyleListItemButton()` helper overrides all four font color states (normal/hover/focus/pressed) to `Colors.Ink` (white) so list rows stay legible under any state.
- **Buy button stayed enabled when player couldn't afford.** `ShopWindow.UpdateDescription()` now checks `gold >= item.BuyPrice` and sets `_buyButton.Disabled` accordingly. After a purchase, affordability is re-checked (gold dropped). Applies in both Buy and Sell modes.
- **Keyboard nav dead-end in Forge/Quests/Bank/Teleport when list is empty.** Each window called `FocusFirstButton(ScrollContent)` which found nothing when the list was empty (no craftable items, no quests, etc.), leaving no initial focus — keyboard users couldn't even reach the Cancel/Close button. Fix: new `UiTheme.FocusFirstButtonOrFallback(primary, fallback)` helper tries the primary list first, falls back to `ContentBox` (whole window) if empty. `FocusFirstButton` now returns `bool` so callers can compose fallbacks.

#### Added
- `UiTheme.StyleListItemButton(Button)` — consistent styling for list rows across Shop, Blacksmith, and future windows. Accent-tinted highlight + white text in all states.
- `UiTheme.FocusFirstButtonOrFallback(Control primary, Control fallback)` — guarantees keyboard users can always reach SOME button on window open, even when the primary list is empty.

### Session 17 — Work Discipline Codified (2026-04-17)

#### Added
- `docs/conventions/work-discipline.md` — canonical convention for AI work discipline ("slow is smooth, smooth is fast"). 7 rules, rework-throughput rationale, warning signs, examples.
- "Work Discipline" section in `AGENTS.md` as a top-level principle (second only to Paradigm).
- Jump-to row in `CLAUDE.md` for Work Discipline; promoted "slow is smooth" to Hard Rule #1.

#### Fixed
- Removed invented AI tool filenames (`CURSOR.md`, `COPILOT.md`) from `docs/conventions/ai-context-files.md` and the `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pointers. Replaced with verified filenames from official docs.

### Session 16 — Tabbed PauseMenu, GoDotTest Rewrite, Transition Fixes, SoulsBorne Death (2026-04-17)

#### Added
- **Tabbed PauseMenu** (Diablo 2-style, 8 tabs: Inventory, Equip, Skills, Abilities*, Quests, Ledger, Stats, System) — replaces the old flat button list. Q/E cycles tabs, Esc toggles open/close, D closes.
- **GoDotTest** (`Chickensoft.GoDotTest` v2.0.28) as the in-game UI test framework. Replaces the old AutoPilot/FullRunSandbox system entirely.
- **Test infrastructure**: `GameTestBase`, `InputHelper` (keyboard/action sim via GodotTestDriver), `UiHelper` (focus/window/pause queries)
- **Test suites** (all keyboard-only, all tied to `docs/flows/*.md` specs):
  - `SplashTests`, `ClassSelectTests`, `TownTests`, `PauseMenuTests`, `NpcTests`, `DeathTests`, `TransitionTests`, `DeathCinematicTests`
- **SoulsBorne "YOU DIED" cinematic** on player death — 6.3s dramatic sequence (overlay fade, red text appears, holds, fades, menu reveals). See `docs/flows/death.md`.
- **`docs/development-paradigm.md`** — public-facing doc on the AI+Human natural-language programming paradigm
- **Prominent README section** describing the paradigm on the GitHub front page
- **Resource leak monitoring** in DebugPanel: orphan node count, node count, modal count (via Godot's `Performance.Monitor`)
- **Auto mode** configured as default via `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Makefile targets: `test-ui`, `test-ui-suite`

#### Fixed
- **Screen transition flash bug** — Every caller using `ScreenTransition.Play()` to swap worlds now hides source content INSIDE the midpoint callback (when overlay is opaque), never before `Play()` starts. Prevents the new scene from briefly rendering under a translucent overlay. Applied to: ClassSelect, splash Continue, TeleportDialog, AscendDialog (3 buttons), FloorWipeDialog (2 buttons), DeathScreen respawn. Verified by `TransitionTests` asserting `OverlayAlpha ≥ 0.99` when new world enters tree.
- **DeathScreen respawn had no transition** — Now uses ScreenTransition so the dungeon→town swap is hidden behind fade-to-black.
- **Resource leaks at exit** — Orphaned Scroll nodes freed in GameWindow._ExitTree(), Theme and tab styles cached as singletons. RID leaks reduced dramatically at shutdown.

#### Changed
- `ScreenTransition.OverlayAlpha` public property added for test inspection
- `WindowStack.Count` and `TopTypeName` added for test assertions
- `UiTheme.CreateGameTheme()` + `CreateTabStyle()` cached as static singletons
- `GameWindow.Close()` only unpauses if `!WindowStack.HasModal` (fixes NPC→Shop race)
- `FocusFirstButton` skips buttons with `FocusMode.None`
- PauseMenu is now a programmatic GameWindow subclass (old `pause_menu.tscn` removed)

#### Removed
- `scripts/testing/AutoPilot*.cs` — replaced by GoDotTest infrastructure
- `scripts/sandbox/FullRunSandbox.cs` + `scenes/sandbox/FullRunSandbox.tscn`
- `scenes/pause_menu.tscn`
- Custom `KeyboardNav.HandleInput` method — replaced by Godot's built-in focus system

### Session 15 — Skills & Abilities Code Implementation (2026-04-16)

#### Added
- New data layer: `MasteryDef`, `AbilityDef`, `MasteryState`, `AbilityState`, `SkillAbilityDatabase` (130 registrations), `ProgressionTracker`
- `GameWindow.cs` — unified base class for all game windows
- `GameTabPanel.cs` — reusable Q/E tab switching system
- `AbilitiesDialog.cs` — class-specific abilities tab (Warrior Arts / Ranger Crafts / Arcane Spells)
- AbilitiesDialog node in `main.tscn`, Abilities button in `pause_menu.tscn`
- 72 new unit tests for data layer

#### Fixed
- NPC crash: `Npc.cs` called `Hide()` instead of `Close()`, corrupting WindowStack and freezing game
- Resource leaks at exit: orphaned Scroll nodes, unreleased GameTabPanel, uncached Theme/StyleBox resources
- Keyboard nav: replaced custom `KeyboardNav.HandleInput` with Godot's built-in focus system (`ui_up`/`ui_down` + `FollowFocus`)
- Focus warnings: `FocusFirstButton` now skips buttons with `FocusMode.None`

#### Changed
- `SkillTreeDialog.cs` — rewritten on GameWindow + GameTabPanel, shows masteries only
- `GameState.cs` — awards SP (2/lvl) + AP (3/lvl) on level-up
- `SaveData.cs` + `SaveSystem.cs` — new fields for masteries, abilities, use counts, category AP
- `Player.cs` — movement blocked when any modal window is open
- `ShopWindow.cs` — Buy/Sell merged into colored buttons, fixed panel resizing
- `UiTheme.cs` — added `CreateTabStyle`, made `CreateColoredButtonStyle` public
- All 13 ScrollContainers — `FollowFocus = true` for keyboard navigation

#### Removed
- Old skill system: `SkillDef.cs`, `SkillDatabase.cs`, `SkillState.cs`, `SkillTracker.cs`
- 671 lines of duplicate window boilerplate (all 14 windows migrated to GameWindow base)

#### Documentation
- `docs/reference/godot4-engine-reference.md` — comprehensive catalog of built-in engine systems and usage status

#### Fixed

- Monster spawn: guaranteed 10 per floor, floor wipe requires 10+ kills
- All scene loads use transition screen (town, dungeon, floor descent)
- Keyboard nav auto-scrolls ScrollContainer to focused button
- Skill targeting uses skill's range, not auto-attack range
- ClassSelect calls Reset() to initialize mana on new game

### Reset — Fresh Start (2026-04-10)

**All code, scenes, and tests deleted.** The pure C# game logic (480 tests passing) was correct, but the Godot rendering layer never worked visually. Starting over with visual-first development.

#### Deleted
- All Godot scene files (6 game scenes, 24+ test scenes)
- All C# scripts (autoloads, dungeon, player, ui, game systems, entity framework)
- All tests (480 unit tests, E2E test infrastructure, shell scripts)
- `archive/phaser-prototype/` (original Phaser 3 prototype)
- `addons/gut/` (GDScript testing addon)

#### Retained
- All documentation (80+ files across 11 directories)
- All assets (819+ sprites, tiles, fonts, icons)
- Config files (project.godot, DungeonGame.csproj, Makefile, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Input map (12 actions in project.godot)
